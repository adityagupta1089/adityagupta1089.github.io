# Types in Computer Science
- powerful frameworks: Hoare logic, algebraic specification lagnauges, modal logics and denotational semantics
- modest power: model checkers, run-time monitoring, **type systems**(most popular, best established lightweight formal method)

## Definition of type system:
- tractable syntatic method
    - typecheckers (compilers + linkers) should be able to do their job automatically, with no manual intervention (though require type annotations)
- for proving the absence of certain program behaviors
    - being static, type systems are conservative, they can categorically prove the absence of some bad program behaviors
- by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute
    - type system can be regarded as a static approximation to the run-time behaviors of the terms in a program.

### Comments:
- type system as tool for reasoning about programs.

## Branches of type systems
- more practical branch concerned with programming languages (focus of book)
    - sacrifice termination propterties for the sake of features like recursive function definitions
- abstract focused on connections between various "pure typed lambda-calculi" and varities of logic, via the Curry-Howard correspondence
    - every well-typed computation is guranteed to terminate

# What type systems are good for

- Detecting Errors
    - early detection of programming errors
- Abstraction
    - module languages: types show up in the interfaces of modules (and related structures, e.g. classes)
- Documentation
    - Type useful when reading programs
- Language Safety
    - protects its own abstractions
    - untrapped errors
    - portabilities
- Efficiency
    - High performance due to information collected by typechecker
- Futher Applications
    - Computer & Network Security
    - Program analysis tools (other than compilers)
    - Alias Analysis
    - Exception Analysis
    - Automated Theorem Proving
    - Databases: e.g. new languages for querying and manipulating XML
    - Computational Linguistics

# Type System and Language Design
- Retrofitting type system onto a language not designed with typechecking can be tricky
  - offer features/encourage programming idioms that make typehchecking difficult/infeasible.
  - concrete syntax of typed languages more complicated than untyped languages.
